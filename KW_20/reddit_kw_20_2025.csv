1kn6rbr,Discussion Thread: US Supreme Court Hears Oral Argument on Whether to Allow Nationwide Injunctions from Lower Courts in Case on Executive Order Seeking to End Birthright Citizenship,"C-SPAN's description-in-advance of today's oral argument is: ""The Supreme Court hears argument in Trump v. CASA, Trump v. Washington, and Trump v. New Jersey, a case about judges stopping President Trump's executive order that limits birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents.""  [Per AP](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-immigration-trump-f01b6c942c4969628ef2e774029c6a0e), ""In arguments Thursday, the Supreme Court weighs the Trump administration’s request to narrow those court orders so that they cover only the parties that sued in federal court. Affected children born in Kentucky would not be citizens, if the court sides with the administration."".
